Just a Stroll
=============

For It this was just a stroll in the park until bloodthirsty pigeons starting
attacking him.  Now you have to keep It alive!  Kill the pigeons by throwing
stones.  Throw them some breadcrumbs to temporarily stop them from following It.
It has an unlimited number of stones but only three portions of breadcrumbs.
Walking over rocks will slow It down, so be careful.
